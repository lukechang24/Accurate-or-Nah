## Game Description

An online multiplayer drawing app that puts the user’s drawing and analyzing abilities to the test. After joining a room, players are given a limited amount of time to input nouns, verbs, and adjectives to generate randomized prompts, draw their selected prompt, and guess the other player’s prompts. While drawing, players are provided tools such as a selection of colors and pen tip sizes, an eraser, and an undo button. At the end of the drawing phase, each players’ drawings are presented one by one, and users must use the provided wordbank to guess which combination of noun, verb, and adjective matches each drawing, and are awarded points for each word in the prompt they match correctly. Throughout the game, players also have the ability to chat with other participants via chatbox, which also serves the purpose to notify users when a player has joined or left the room.
