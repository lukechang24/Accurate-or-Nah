# Drawing Game

A website where you can draw silly prompts with your friends

## How to Play

To start, you must be registered to create a room, where you wait for other players to join your room. Click start when everyone is in, and players will be prompted to fill in as many nouns, verbs, and adjectives as they can before time runs out. Then, the words inputted by all the players will be scrambled up and randomly assigned to each player, in which they have to create a prompt from those words. They are then sent to a drawing phase, where they attempt to draw their selected prompt as best as possible.
